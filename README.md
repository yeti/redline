React / React Native Component Library using React Primitives





## What is this?

This library attempts to create a single library 
for React and React Native components that
don't use platform-specific APIs.





### Component Library

#### Parameters for `<PopupMenu />`

```js
{
	width: ?number = 200,
	height: ?(number | 'auto') = 'auto', // If auto it's minimized to rows size
	direction: ?('top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right') = 'top',
	button: ReactNode
}
```
